## Project Setup
- You can simply git clone the main branch. The project is using Unity 2022.3.45f version.
- Due to the large file of the Vuforia configuration, make sure to donwload the .tgz file from [here](https://ubcca-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/rishav_banerjee_ubc_ca/Documents/IMTC%20505%20(%2724)/ARcheologists/Whispers%20of%20the%20Fountain/AR%20app%20Vuforia%20tgz%20file/com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.28.4.tgz?csf=1&web=1&e=hscZSZ), and place it in the Packages folder (next to the manifest) before opening the project to avoid any errors or mismatch in versions.
